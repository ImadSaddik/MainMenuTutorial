# Safety First!

Safety First is a VR project designed to educate individuals about workplace safety and health using immersive experiences. It offers various environments, such as PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) and pictogram, among others. The game features two distinct modes: training and testing. In the training phase, players are guided through environments to grasp essential concepts, while the testing phase evaluates their comprehension and application of learned principles.
